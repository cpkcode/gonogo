# Kill Your Darlings: A Ruthless Framework for Product Decisions

Most product ideas don't die because they're bad. They die because they're "good enough" to keep working on, but not good enough to win.

We fall in love with our ideas. We succumb to the Sunk Cost Fallacy. We confuse "enthusiasm" with "evidence."

To combat this, I built the **9 Levers Framework**—a ruthlessly logic-driven system to score product opportunities. It forces you to ignore how you *feel* and focus on what you can *prove*.

## The Framework at a Glance

The model evaluates ideas across 9 distinct levers, weighted by importance.

### The "Big Three" (3x Weight)
These are the make-or-break factors. If you fail here, nothing else matters.
1.  **Market Window (Timing)**: Is there a specific external catalyst closing a window of opportunity? (e.g., new regulation, competitor sunset).
2.  **Strategic Moat**: Do you have a defensible advantage that compounds? (Patents, data network effects). "We execute better" is not a moat.
3.  **Distribution Edge**: Do you have direct access to customers today? (e.g., 10k+ newsletter subscribers).

### The Validators (2x Weight)
These validate the opportunity and your ability to execute.
4.  **Conviction Level**: profound commitment backed by sacrifice (time/money), not just excitement.
5.  **Option Value**: Does this unlock major future opportunities even if it fails?
6.  **External Validation**: Do credible, unbiased experts say "Go"?
7.  **Regulatory Ease**: clear path vs. impossible hurdles.
8.  **Pipeline Alternatives**: Is this truly the best idea you have right now?

### The Killer (Penalty)
9.  **Sunk Cost Bias (-1x Weight)**: The only negative score. If you're doing this because "we've already come this far," you lose points.

## The Decision

The framework outputs a score out of 170.
*   **> 70**: Strong Go.
*   **40-69**: Cautious Proceed.
*   **< 40**: Strong No-Go.

## Try the Agent

I've turned this framework into an interactive tool that interviews you, challenges your weak evidence, and calculates your score automatically.
